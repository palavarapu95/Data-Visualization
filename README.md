This Visualization will explains about the trends in Automotive of United States.
Data is taken from the public domains and subjected to any changes.

Story behind the infographic 

Information graphics are three times more effective in studying and understanding the information when compared with the reading the data in which the data is formatted in a story manner so that the viewer is more likely to understand the data. When we come to our data of trends in the automotive, the major theme behind the infographics is that to know that which types of vehicles are creating more pollution and whatâ€™s their trends in mileage and as well as their horsepower. We can know from the first area graph that which type of vehicles are having the highest production share that is sedan/wagon car is continuously having the highest production share than others that is nearly 41% and we look at its Co2 emission, they are more evolving the gas in city where people live more which is more dangerous.
When we compare the dismissal of Co2 from the vehicle from past 4 decades, it has been gradually decreasing but still need be more. 
When we come to its MPG (Miles per gallon) which varies from vehicle to vehicle and differs between the companies, and it is also having improvement in increasing its capacity from past 3 decades but not in a rapid manner and there is an interesting segment comes into notice that MPG is high in highways rather than in cities and it is nearly 10% of change which is parallel same from 1975.
When we consider the horsepower of sedans/wagons, they are increasing in a steady state manner so from this we can say that automobile companies are trying to give less Co2 with higher MPG and Horsepower, so that the buyer will experience the essence of driving.
Quality of vehicle is dependent on many factors like generally metal used in manufacturing the car, its MPG, maintenance and many more, but if the company has used the quality metal in manufacturing the car then its obvious that its weight will be high, and its MPG will be low. When we look at the statistics of the data regarding the vehicle weight there is a sudden decrease and then after few years there is a study weight is maintained in cars. This may be because to maintain the required quality of vehicle. There is nearly 46% change of weight from its staring to the end of data. Finally, there is a considerable chance in automotive regarding all the aspects of Manufacturing and which are helpful for environment as well as to the future generations.

Justification  

While building the infographics an appropriate graph or chart type should be used. Colours used in the visualisation of data will also play a major role in understanding the information very clearly and quickly to the viewer.
